# Snippets

Holder for code challenges, interesting code snippets, and anything else that's neat.

## What this is

- This is a digital scrapbook of random things I've done, liked, appreciated, or hacked together.
- This will include code challenges completed for job interviews, or exercises from Project Euler, Advent of Code, course tutorials, or any other similar challenge oriented sites.
- This will include quotes from books, speakers, or articles that I find worth compiling (and sharing).
- This will include references to cool things I've done, written, or anything else that I would want to maybe scrapbook.
- This is the good, the **bad**, and the _**ugly**_ of my career. Dates in commits are inaccurate to when I completed the challenge prior to December 2017.
- This is my baring my mind, process, and opinions to public scrutiny.

## What this is not (necessarily)

- This is not (necessarily) stuff that I'm proud of, but we all make mistakes or do dumba** things, so you get the terrible with the horrible.
- This is not (necessarily) stuff that has gone through the rigours of normal software engineering flow. Especially things that I did during a pairing interview, hackathon, or any other time-bound exercise that is meant to be quickly done with little vetting.
