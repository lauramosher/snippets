# SM-808 Splicers Coding Challenge Exercise

Solution by Laura Mosher // laura@lauramosher.com

This challenge was issued by [Splice](https://github.com/mattetti/sm-808).

## Getting Started

sm808 relies on Ruby 2.4+

Execute the program with `ruby sm808.rb`. The program currently executes once and quits.

## Development

This program uses rubocop for linting. This is unnecesary for the actual runtime of the program.

Run `bundle install` to install `rubocop` and dependencies.

### Tests

There are unit tests available using Ruby's `Test::Unit::TestCase`.

Run all of the tests: `ruby test/tc_all.rb`
